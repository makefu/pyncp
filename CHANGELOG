18.03.2010 added stripping to the sending peer as well
           This is still a bit messy, but it seems to be working.
           To be tested
08.02.2010 Added GUI to pyncp, now pyncp_vis
           The source code is more like a playground but working pretty well
           Added ability to extract into folder ( to avoid trailing ../.. , see WARNING in official
           API. 
           Added threading to be able to spawn multiple instances ( not sure yet why but hey)
           Even with the GUI, nobody can stand the power of the command line!
           replaced the exit(0) with a graceful socket close ( wait for 1 second, close then)
05.02.2010 Replaced closefds() with exit(0) to avoid abrupt socket/file closing when transmitting
03.02.2010 Added Broadcast to the "push" function
01.02.2010 Added "push" and "poll" functionality with Multicasting
